The predator-prey equations, also known as the Lotka-Volterra equations, describe the dynamics of two interacting species in an ecosystem in terms of non-linear differential equations.

The two interacting time-dependent observables are the number of prey, @op{prey : ‚Ñù‚Üí‚Ñù},
and the number of predators, @op{predators : ‚Ñù‚Üí‚Ñù}. Although the number of individuals of a species is really an integer, it is taken to be a real number for the benefit of using differential equations. The two coupled equations for @term{prey} and @term{predators}
are
@inset{
  @equation{pp1: ùíü(prey) = (prey-growth-rate √ó prey) - predation-rate √ó predators √ó prey}
  @equation{pp2: ùíü(predators) = (predator-growth-rate √ó predators √ó prey) - predator-loss-rate √ó predators}}

These equations are based on a few assumptions:
@itemlist[
  @item{In the absence of predators, the prey exihibits exponential growth described by @op{prey-growth-rate : ‚Ñùp}.}
  @item{The number of prey decreases by predation, which is @op{predation-rate : ‚Ñùp} times the number of encounters between individuals of each species. The latter is taken to be proportional to both @term{prey} and @term{predators}.}
  @item{In the absence of prey, the number of predators decreases by starvation, described by @op{predator-loss-rate : ‚Ñùp}.}
  @item{The number of predators grows with the availability of food, which, like predation, is proportional to both @term{prey} and @term{predators} with the proportionality constant @op{predator-growth-rate : ‚Ñùp}.}]
